    "Descriptive Statistics Example: A company analyzes sales data for the past year, calculating the total sales, average monthly sales, and sales distribution across regions to understand their performance and identify trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics Example: A pharmaceutical company conducts a clinical trial with a sample of patients to determine the effectiveness of a new drug. The results from the sample are then used to infer the drug's effectiveness in the broader population, helping to decide if the drug should be approved for general use."

    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability (Dispersion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The variance is the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standar Definition: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile).\n",
    "\n",
    "Application in Describing a Dataset \n",
    "Mean: Useful for datasets with a normal distribution or when you need an average value for predictive analytics. \n",
    "Median: Ideal for skewed distributions or when outliers are present, as it provides a better central value. \n",
    "Mode: Helpful for understanding the most frequent value, especially in categorical data. \n",
    "Range: Gives a quick sense of the spread but can be misleading with outliers. \n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: Essential for understanding data spread and variability, especially in normally distributed data. IQR: Best for datasets with outliers or non-normal distributions, providing a measure of spread that focuses on the central portion of the data."
